		RLKit - Reversing Labs (first aid) Kit 4.0
		------------------------------------------

  After seeing a lot of so called crackers kits being spread around which
weight  overcomes  10  and  sometimes  20  MB  i decided to create a real
minimum  reverser  kit. That kind of first aid kit would contain only the
most  used  applications by all reversers. So this is a bearbone kit that
proves  that all you can need during reversing of 90% of applications can
be packed in one package that weighs lesser than 3 MB. This kit contains:

 + OllyDBG 1.10
 + LordPE 1.4
 + ImpRec 1.6
 + PeID 0.94
 + 32bit Calculator 1.7
 + RepairPE 0.4
 + FileMon 7.03
 + RegMon 7.03
 + FSG 2.0
 + WinUPack 0.39
 + R!SC`s Process Patcher 1.5.1
