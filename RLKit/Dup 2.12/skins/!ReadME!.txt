Creating own skins

dUP support *.res files which can be created for example with:
 -Resource Hacker 3.4.0 	[http://www.users.on.net/johnson/resourcehacker/]
 -Resource Builder 2.0 		[http://www.sicomponents.com]
 
You can use "skin2k5.res" as template for your own res file. Don't delete controls which have an ID number and also don not modify this number,else the patcher will not work. its no problem to add other controls like BMP Pictures.
